A sample showing how to encrypt 64-bit values. 
It is a reverse of the Decrypt() function found here https://code.google.com/p/privatedatacommunicationprotocol/
and described here https://developers.google.com/ad-exchange/rtb/response-guide/decrypt-price.

Run the sample with the first argument being the price. You can then use the code from the link above to decrypt
it. The decrypt sample has the value hardcoded in line 188 (the 1.0.1 version) or line 249 (the 2.0.1 version).

Sample code depends on
	libssl-dev
	libmodpbase64-dev
